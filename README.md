## About the Video Course
Do you fear network security, availability, and potential downtime and have real concerns about deploying your web applications to the cloud? Microsoft Azure allows you to add cloud capabilities to your existing network through its Platform as a Service model. Microsoft Azure is a cloud platform for building, deploying, and managing services and applications anywhere across multiple data centers. This course will show you how to deploy and run Node.js web applications on Microsoft Azure and make them production-ready with backup services, monitoring, and scaling tools. You will create a cloud storage, including setting up and hosting static web applications on Microsoft storage blobs. You will also see how to load-balance your web applications using Azure Network Load Balancer, making them more resilient and stable. You will also focus on creating cloud databases connecting your Node.js application to a MySQL server hosted in Azure, and maintaining it. We also show you how to upload a Docker Container image to Azure, run it as a Web App, and service the image. By the end of the course, you will have learned the skills needed to develop, deploy, and manage Node.js web applications and services in Microsoft Azure with confidence.
